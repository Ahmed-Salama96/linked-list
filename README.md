# linked-list
This is a c++ linked list program which was an assignment in the Data structure course during my B.S. degree. the program covers a lot of linked list functions like: create new linked list, destroy linked list, print linked list, insert/delete in/from the rear, insert/delete  in/from front, insert / delete from a given position and search in a linked list. I HOPE YOU ENJOY THAT
